ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

Hi, Iâ€™m Stan Wu, a remote engineer specializing in customized AAOS and AOSP frameworks for U.S.-based startups. I manage services on Linode and GCP while collaborating with international teams. My expertise spans Android x86 and Allwinner solutions, and I actively integrate the principle of "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" into my work. Passionate about clean code and innovative solutions, Iâ€™m always looking to contribute to impactful projects.
