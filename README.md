ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

Iâ€™m Stan Wu, a remote worker specializing in developing customized AAOS and AOSP frameworks for U.S.-based startups. I also manage services on Linode and GCP platforms while collaborating with international teams to drive projects forward. I believe that "simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" and incorporate this philosophy into my technical development and solution design.
