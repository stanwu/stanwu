👋 Hi,

We come from the logical world of programming, once believing that everything could be predicted and controlled.
It wasn’t until we encountered AI that we realized:
Intelligence is not merely a stack of rules,
but a subtle presence woven through countless experiences—
full of ambiguity, yet deeply real.
**I have always believed that simplicity is the ultimate form of beauty.**

我們從程式設計的邏輯世界走來，以為萬物都能被預測與控制，直到遇見 AI，才發現智慧不只是規則的堆疊，而是滲透在無數經驗中的模糊與真實。
**我也始終堅信：「簡單，就是極致的美學」。**
